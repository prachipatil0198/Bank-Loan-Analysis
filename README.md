# 📊 Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard  

## 🔹 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **bank loan data** using **PostgreSQL** and **Power BI** to uncover insights into loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, and borrower demographics. The analysis transforms raw loan data into **interactive dashboards** that support **risk management, portfolio monitoring, and customer insights** for banking institutions.  

---

## 🔹 Tools & Technologies  
- **PostgreSQL** – Database creation, SQL queries, KPI calculations  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard design and visualization  
- **Excel** – Data validation and quick comparisons  

---

## 🔹 Key Functionalities & Skills Applied  
### **PostgreSQL**  
- Database & table creation  
- Data cleaning and transformations  
- Advanced SQL queries with `CTE`, `PARTITION`, `GROUP BY`, `DATEPART`, and aggregations  
- Business metric derivation (MTD, MoM, KPIs)  

### **Power BI**  
- Data cleaning & modeling with Power Query  
- DAX measures (Date functions, SUMX, Calculate, Filters)  
- Time Intelligence (MTD, MoM analysis)  
- Building KPIs, card visuals, charts, treemaps, and interactive navigation

## 🔹 Dashboards & Insights  

### **1. Summary Dashboard**  
- **KPIs**: Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Avg. Interest Rate, Avg. DTI  
- **Good vs Bad Loans**: Application %, Funded Amount, Total Received Amount  
- **Loan Status Grid**: Portfolio health across loan statuses  

### **2. Overview Dashboard**  
- **Monthly Trends** (Line Chart) – Identify seasonality in lending  
- **Regional Lending** (Map) – Highlight lending activity by state  
- **Loan Term Distribution** (Donut Chart)  
- **Borrower Profiles**:  
  - Employment Length (Bar Chart)  
  - Loan Purpose (Bar Chart)  
  - Home Ownership (Tree Map)  

### **3. Details Dashboard**  
- A **one-stop view** of borrower profiles, loan terms, repayment status, and portfolio performance  
- Drill-through navigation for granular insights
